# Roblox-Moderation-Bot
## What is this?
Roblox Moderation Bot is a Discord bot that allows you to ban, and unban players from your game straight from Discord. There are currently only two moderation commands: Ban, and Unban. There might be more commands coming soon.

## How do I set it up?
- Log into Roblox
- Go to create.roblox.com
- Once you're on the website, create a new API key
