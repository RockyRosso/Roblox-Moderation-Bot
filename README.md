## What is this?
Roblox Moderation Bot is a Discord bot that allows you to ban, and unban players from your game straight from Discord. There are currently only two moderation commands: Ban, and Unban. There might be more commands coming soon.

## How do I set it up?
- Log into Roblox
- Go to create.roblox.com
- Once you're on the website, create a new API key

- You're now able to edit the API key. Be sure to title it to whatever fits your pleasing

- You'll then see a button saying: _Add API System_. Click on the shown button
- Upon clicking the button, you'll be met with an option to add an experience. Type or select a name from the dropdown. The name has to be the name of the experience you want the bot to communicate with. After selecting the experience of your choosing, click _Add Experience_

- Upon adding your experience, you'll be prompted to add operations. Here are some recommended operations I recommend in order for the bot to work at it's fullest

- After selecting your preferred operations, sroll down to security. If you're planning to self host this bot, enter you're IP address into the Accepted IP Addresses. If you're planning to host the bot on a third party hosting service, enter in the following

- After you enter an IP address, click on _Save & Generate Key_
- You'll then be prompted to copy your API key to your clipboard. Remember that Roblox will not store the API key, meaning if you exit out of the API key settings or refresh the page, you'll no longer be able to access it
