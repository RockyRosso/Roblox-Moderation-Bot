## What is this?
Roblox Moderation Bot is a Discord bot that allows you to ban, and unban players from your game straight from Discord. There are currently only two moderation commands: Ban, and Unban. There might be more commands coming soon.

## How do I set it up?
If you wish to set up the bot for your own server, you can find the tutorial [here](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/how-to-set-up-roblox-moderation-bot/1799866).
